## TODO

- [ ] Clone microSD card
* Add **power off** button to GUI
```
sudo shutdown -h now
```
* Reconfigure hardware
* Upgrade to RPi 4 and 64 MP camera
* Split this repo so that it covers only sticy trap imaging hardware and software (RPi+camera etc.) Create a new repo, **sticky-trap-image-analysis**, to cover the rest
